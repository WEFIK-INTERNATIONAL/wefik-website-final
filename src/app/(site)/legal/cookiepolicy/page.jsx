                As is common practice with almost all professional websites,
                this site uses cookies, which are tiny files downloaded to your
                computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what
                information they gather, how we use it, and why we sometimes
                need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can
                prevent these cookies from being stored, however this may
                downgrade or “break” certain elements of the site&apos;s
                functionality.

                1. How We Use Cookies
              </h2>
              <p>
                We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below.
                Unfortunately, in most cases there are no industry standard
                options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the
                functionality and features they add to this site. It is
                recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure
                whether you need them or not, in case they are used to provide a
                service that you use.

              </h2>
              <p>
                You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings
                on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be
                aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of
                this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies
                will usually also disable certain functionality and features of
                this site. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not disable
                cookies.

                Hopefully that has clarified things for you. As was previously

                you need or not, it&apos;s usually safer to leave cookies enabled, in
                case it interacts with one of the features you use on our site.
