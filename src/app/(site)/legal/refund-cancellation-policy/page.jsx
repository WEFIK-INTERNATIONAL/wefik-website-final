                Thank you for choosing our Web Development / SAAS / Software
                Development services. We strive to provide the best user
                experience and customer satisfaction. However, we understand
                that there may be situations where you need to cancel a purchase
                or request a refund. This Refund and Cancellation Policy
                outlines the guidelines and procedures for such cases.

              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                For subscription-based products or services, you can cancel your
                subscription at any time. Upon cancellation, you will continue
                to have access to the product or service until the end of the
                current billing cycle. No further charges will be incurred. To
                cancel your subscription, please follow the instructions
                provided in your account settings or contact our customer
                support team.

              <p>
                Perpetual license products are one-time purchases without an
                expiration date. Cancellation does not apply to perpetual
                license products as they are not tied to a subscription model.
                However, you may be eligible for a refund as described in
                Section 2.
